 2. Language bindings for python (Possibly also for Rust? Go? Java? C#?)  --- partly done by Aditya
 3. Switch to smphost tools (https://virtee.io/) --- Ye
 4. thread safety for policy store
 5. Example showing how to run Certifier in TEE with key provisioning --- jlm
 6. Integration with Confidential Containers from IBM et al
 7. GPU support for Nvidia
 8. Perf tests, Fuzz testing, valgrind for memory leaks
 9. Check enclave to enclave certification (without certifier service)
10. Write/read/open/close_encrypted (DoD request)
11. DCAP independent platform attestation for SGX (and TDX?)
12. Nitro
13. TDX
14. C++ --> Rust --> C++ (Microsoft suggestion)
15. Token issuing serevice example
16. Add service API bindings instructions for secure channels. Like https://krpc.github.io/krpc/communication-protocols/tcpip.html.
17. Sample ACL implementation for access over API's using program measurment as principle name.
18. Investigate fragile mutual auth TLS connections (mostly done)
