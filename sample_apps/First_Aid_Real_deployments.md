Important concepts in real deployments
--------------------------------------

The "simple_app" family of examples is intended to carefully take you through every
step of building and deploying applications, in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
understanding of the every design feature of the Certifier Framework.  Thorough enough
to make a detailed security assessment and develop a clear understanding of the security
implications of each and every component.

However, for real use there will be several important differences.  First, the detailed
instructions in "instructions.md," while intended for "copy and paste" learning will,
almost certainly be replaced by a very few shell scripts.  For example, run_example.sh,
in the sample_apps directory, performs this "one step" provisioning for all the applications.
If you're not a shell programming guru, you can simply turn the instructions.md (or script
file) into a shell script to build everything automatically.  Second, the subdirectories
provisioning, service, app1_data and app2_data are not generally distributed and must
be stored, with care.

Deploying an application (or VM) consists merely of distributing the compiled application
or service in the VM.  One common way to do this, for a VM is to put the apps and/or service
in initramfs, then all the applications and shared libraries are measured as part of "Direct Boot."

The subdirectories created when you build the applications and certifier_service, in the examples,
are used as follows in deployment:

    The provisioning directory is a staging directory.  It is used on a single machine to
    prepare for deployment.  It is not distributed with either the certifier_service OR
    the application, ever.

    The service directory is distributed with the certifier service.  The only files needed are
    policy.bin (which contains the signed policy) and, if you run your certifier service with
    unencrypted policy_key provisioning (which is NOT recommended --- see the certifier_in_tee
    example), the policy key file.

    The app storage directories (app1_data and app2_data) are similarly never distributed.  A
    cardinal rule of the design is that NO file except the apps are security critical so none
    of those files should be distributed, nor should they require a secure storage capability.
    Those files can (and should) be stored in a network accessible location which is NOT part of any
    measurement; they should definitely not be in intiramfs if you do direct boot.  Simulated_enclave
    is an exception, since its attestation and platform keys are kept there.  Indeed, because the app
    directories contain files that differ between platforms on the very same hardware type, measuring
    these would mean that the "app measurement" varied from one SEV platform to another which
    is a disaster for scalability and app management.  ONLY the app need be distributed.  As a
    convenience, platform certs are stored in these directories and they should NOT be distributed
    as they will vary among hardware of the same type.  Again, platform certificates should
    be downloaded from a network service.  SEV and SGX can actually retrieve these certificates from
    the hardware, so the measurements don't change and when possible, these will be fetched automatically;
    however, support varies from platform to platform and may rely on features of the VMM so this is
    not illustrated currently in the "simple_apps."

As first aid, remember that, unlike the exhaustively explained simple_app run on a development machine,
to help speed development, actual deployment requires deploying very few files: only the app (e.g.-
example_app.exe) on the application machines, none of the provisioning directory files and only two
of the files in the service directory.
